Instructions:
 
Simply type "make" to compile. To run, enter "p1" followed by two integer arguments for the viewing window's width and height respectively. 
Arguments of 600, 600 do nicely. You will then be promped to enter "b" or "B" to have the default polygons represented in the input file  
drawn using Bresenham's Algorithm or enter "d" or "D" to use the DDA Algorithm. These polygons will be rasterized.

Once the polygons have been rendered, you may right click anywhere on the viewing window and a menu will appear. In this menu you may select 
to translate, scale, or rotate any of the poygons pictured. 

To translate: 
When prompted, type the x followed by the y value of translation and hit enter.

To scale: 
When prompted, type the magnitude of the scaling and hit enter. 

To rotate: 
When prompted, type the angle of rotation in radians. A positive angle will rotate the selected polygon counter-clockwise.  

The following algorithm/code line references indicate that algorithm's implemenation location as found in main.cpp:


Digital Differential Analyzer.....................................106-122
Bresenham's Algorithm.............................................123-213
Rasterization.....................................................216-246
Scaling...........................................................346-384
Rotation..........................................................385-426
Translation.......................................................427-451

As of this time, no clipping facilities have been written.
